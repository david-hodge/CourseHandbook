## Course Handbook template

This contains two templates. The `nologo` version creates html and docx versions.

They'll totally optional and customizable. **You will almost certainly want to adjust the order or elements, and delete/add some sections**. 

## Logo or no logo?

The version with logo, called `CHT1234.qmd` doesn't by default create a docx as it is difficult to get the logo in docx to appear correctly. 

If you do want a logo and docx, then just add `docx: default` to the right place in the `CHT1234.qmd` template (see where it goes in `CHT1234_nologo.qmd`) and then **manually open the docx and adjust the logo**. 

## Moodle upload

If you want to upload to Moodle, this is a self-contained single HTML.

If you also created a docx, then upload both HTML and docx into a single file upload. Then the hyperlink in the HTML to the docx will work.
